          <h3>Early Life & Education</h3>
          <p>Born on August 20, 1833, in North Bend, Ohio, Benjamin Harrison came from a distinguished political family
            - he was the grandson of President William Henry Harrison. He graduated from Miami University in Oxford,
            Ohio, in 1852.</p>
          <p>After studying law, Harrison moved to Indianapolis to establish his practice. His leadership qualities
            emerged during the Civil War, where he served as a colonel in the Union Army, an experience that greatly
            influenced his future political perspectives.</p>
